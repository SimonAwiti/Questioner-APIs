## Testing the endpoints

* Install python then using pip install .. install flask
* clone the repo
* Ensure that postman is installed
* From your terminal locate the repo and run: python run.py
* open postman and test the endpoints
* Use unittest to run the the tests

## Setting up and how to start the application

* Install python then using pip instal .. install flask
* clone the repo
* From your terminal Ensure that the virtual environment is activated
* From the terminal locate the repo and run: python run.py

# How to get started

Start by making a directory where we will work on. Simply Open your terminal and then:

```
mkdir Questioner-ADC
```

Afterwhich we go into the directory:

```
cd Questioner-ADC
```

## Create a Python Virtual Environment for our Project

Since we are using Python 3, create a virtual environment by typing:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

Before we install our project's Python requirements, we need to activate the virtual environment. You can do that by typing:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Clone and Configure a Flask Project

Login into your github account and open the project folder then follow the instruction on how to clone the existing project. It should be something similar to:

```
git clone https://github.com/SimonAwiti/Questioner-APIs.git
```

Next, install the requirements by typing:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the app

```
flask run
```

## Unit Testing
To test the endpoints ensure that the following tools are available the follow steps below
   ### Tools:
     Postman

## Technology used

* Python 3.6
* Flask framework
* Unittest for testing

## Background context 

Published POSTMAN documentation
